We are going to use the https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-clover-plugin[Gradle Clover Plugin]
to generating a code coverage report using Clover.

We are going to create a gradle file to keep the Clover configuration in one place

[source, groovy]
.gradle/clover.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/gradle/clover.gradle[]
----

<1> Although, Clover is open source, you need to create a dummy license file.
<2> We don't want certain files to pollute our code coverage reports.
<3> We want to include our Spock specifications as test files.
<4> We want reports in both XML and HTML

We are going to reference this file from the ROOT `build.gradle`

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/build.gradle[]
----

<1> Add the plugin as a build script depedency
<2> Apply the build file with Clover configuration.
<3> Currently, you need to add the groovy dependency for Clover Gradle plugin to work.
<4> Exclude this library to avoid problems using docker with tomcat in the deployment

Note that, in addition to the mode, the above example configures the `tenantResolverClass` to use to resolve the tenant.

The `tenantResolverClass` is a class that implements the link:{gormapi}/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/TenantResolver.html[TenantResolver] interface.

Included within GORM there are several built-in `TenantResolver` implementations including:

.Available TenantResolver Implementations
|===
| Type | Description

|link:{gormapi}/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/web/SessionTenantResolver.html[SessionTenantResolver]
|Resolves the tenant id from the HTTP session using an attribute called `gorm.tenantId`

|link:{gormapi}/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/web/CookieTenantResolver.html[CookieTenantResolver]
|Resolves the tenant id from the HTTP cookie using an attribute called `gorm.tenantId`

|link:{gormapi}/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/web/SubDomainTenantResolver.html[SubDomainTenantResolver]
|Resolves the tenant id from the current sub-domain. For example if the subdomain is `foo.mycompany.com`, the tenant id would be `foo`

|link:{gormapi}/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/resolvers/SystemPropertyTenantResolver.html[SystemPropertyTenantResolver]
| Resolves the tenant id from a system property called `gorm.tenantId`. Mainly useful for testing

|===

The above implementations are useful to have out-of-the-box, however GORM is flexible and you can implement your own strategy by implementing the `TenantResolver` interface.

TIP: For example if you are using Spring Security you could write a `TenantResolver` that resolves the tenant id from the currently logged in user.
